FAVORITE FUNCTION: 
function getAnswer() {
    const allCards = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(".card"));
    allCards.forEach((card) => {
      if (card.innerText !== "") {
        card.addEventListener("click", showQuestion);
      } else {
        card.classList.add("emptyCard");
      }
    });

    // ^^ Displays Questions once card is clicked, and also displays empty card when question has been answered. ^^
  
    const cardOfButton = modalInside;

    if (cardOfButton.getAttribute("data-correct") === this.innerText) {
      score = score + parseInt(cardOfButton.getAttribute("data-value"));
      if (score < 0) {
        scoreTotal.style.color = "red";
      } else {
        scoreTotal.style.color = "whitesmoke";
      }
      scoreTotal.innerText = `Score: ${score}`;
    } else if (cardOfButton.getAttribute("data-correct") != this.innerText) {
      score = score - parseInt(cardOfButton.getAttribute("data-value"));
      if (score < 0) {
        scoreTotal.style.color = "red";
      }
      scoreTotal.innerText = `Score: ${score}`;
    }
    cardOfButton.removeEventListener("click", showQuestion);

    // ^^ Adds or Subtracts from Score depending on Right/Wrong answer given. If score falls below 0, score color will change to red to indicate negative current score. ^^
  
    if (attempts === 0) {
      if (score < 0) {
        alert(
          "The world of Pokemon might not be right for you."
        );
      } else if (score < 5000) {
        alert(
          "Keep training, you're not quite ready to face the Pokemon League."
        );
      } else if (score < 10000) {
        alert(
          "Great work, but you still have a little work to do if you want to become Champion!"
        );
      } else {
        alert(
          "Congratulations! You're the new Pokémon League Champion!"
        );
